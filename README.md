## Check Webpage Server Time (Python, Selenium)

This Python script uses Selenium to automate tasks on a website.  
It goes to the Liberty University website, checks the server's current time, and waits until it's exactly 12:01. When the time matches, it prints a message like "Hello, it's 12:01!". You can add your own actions or code to run when this specific time is reached.  
The script keeps checking until the desired time arrives and the browser stays open unless you uncomment a line to close it.
